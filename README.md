## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v14 or higher)
* npm (v6 or higher)
* MongoDB (ensure it's running locally on `mongodb://localhost:27017`)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd Recipe_Social
```

### 2. Backend Setup

Navigate to the `backend` directory, install dependencies, and create a `.env` file.

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following content:

```
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/recipe_social
JWT_SECRET=supersecretjwtkey
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```
Replace `your_cloud_name`, `your_api_key`, and `your_api_secret` with your actual Cloudinary credentials.

### 3. Start the Backend Server

Ensure your MongoDB instance is running. Then, start the backend server:

```bash
npm start
```
The backend API will be running on `http://localhost:5000`. You should see "MongoDB Connected" and "Server running on port 5000" in your terminal.

### 4. Frontend Setup

Open a new terminal, navigate to the `frontend` directory, and install dependencies.

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### 5. Start the Frontend Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```
The frontend application will be running on `http://localhost:5173`.
